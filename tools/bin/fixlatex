# Perform some obscure postprocessing to obtain valid LaTeX code.
# If you know a better way (such as using babel or integration into
# Driver.pm or LaTeX.pm) let it me know.
# Maybe the subroutine _cdata in LaTeX.pm is a good place, but we don't
# want to call bg5conv for each little string, right?
#
# Further customization of LaTeX code in the compound conversion commands 
# such as debiandoc2latexpdf can be accomplished with "-s script" option.
#
#  Called as "fixlatex -l <lang> <infile> <outfile>" for the modification.
